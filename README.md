TEAMS-Module
============

The respository for the TEAMS Module being developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology to go onto the GREET Model of emissions tracking and lifecycle analysis.
TEAMS stands for Total Energy and Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems. The gist of it is that TEAMS is to shipping vessels on the water, as GREET is to similar vehicles on land. 

The basic workflow for this project is as such: 

1) Install the plugin by placing it in the folder containing the greet.exe file (Can be found by opening GREET and going to the about button in the about tab)

2) Open GREET and then click on the new TEAMS plugin

3) Agree to the copyright information

4) Upon opening TEAMS, you start going through and editing the various input tabs from their default state, and make them reflect the values your particular analysis requires

5) When you are ready to submit each tab, scroll to the bottom and hit the submit button

6) Once all tabs are submitted you are eligible to run the simulation, and get your results.
