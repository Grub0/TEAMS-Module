TEAMS-Module
============

The respository for the TEAMS Module being developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology to go onto the GREET Model of emissions tracking and lifecycle analysis.

Overview
--------

TEAMS stands for Total Energy and Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems. TEAMS is the first-ever model able to calculate total fuel-cycle emissions and energy use for marine vessels. The model has been updated to serve as a plugin within GREET and uses GREET pathways to do its calculations.

More information on the TEAMS Model can be found at: http://www.rit.edu/cla/teams/

Workflow
--------

The basic workflow for this project is as such: 

1) Install the plugin by placing the compiled .dll file in the folder containing the greet.exe file (Can be found by opening GREET and going to the about button in the about tab)

2) Open GREET and then click on the new TEAMS plugin

3) Agree to the copyright information

4) Upon opening TEAMS, you may access and edit the various input values from their default state and make them reflect the values your particular analysis requires

5) When you are ready to submit each tab, scroll to the bottom and hit the submit button

6) Once all tabs are submitted you are eligible to run the simulation and get your results.
