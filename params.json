TEAMS expands on the functionality of GREET by allowing for the total fuel cycle analysis associated with maritime vessels.  With this new TEAMS-Module, we allow for a more seamless integration of TEAMS into the new GREET API framework. The TEAMS Module runs within GREET 2013, and uses GREETâ€™s fuel pathways as part of its calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe TEAMS plugin brings the original spreadsheet layout of TEAMS into GREET with an easy to use interface. The plugin was developed by Rob Clifford (@Grub0) and Shayde Nofziger (@ShaydeNofziger). The project was headed by [Dr. James Winebrake](http://people.rit.edu/jjwgpt/) at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nMore information on the TEAMS project can be obtained by contacting Dr. James Winebrake (jjwgpt@rit.edu).\r\nMore information on the GREET model is available [here](https://greet.es.anl.gov/greet/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
