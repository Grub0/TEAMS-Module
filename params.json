{"name":"TEAMS-Module","tagline":"The respository for the TEAMS/GREET Module developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology for tracking life cycle emissions in the marine sector.","body":"### Downloading TEAMS\r\nIn order to run the TEAMS application from within GREET, download and extract the following .zip folder:\r\n* https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtkbb3tk5rn95p6/TEAMS_Download.zip\r\n\r\nIn order to install the application, you must copy the two DLL files to GREET's application folder. A tutorial will be available soon to assist with this.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to TEAMS-Module\r\nThe Total Energy & Emissions Analysis for Maritime Systems Model, TEAMS, was developed by undergraduate researchers at the Rochester Institute of Technology. TEAMS expands on the functionality of GREET by allowing for the life cycle fuel analysis of maritime vessels. More information on TEAMS is available [here](rit.edu/cla/teams). The TEAMS Module runs within GREET 2013, and uses GREETâ€™s fuel pathways as part of its calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe TEAMS plugin brings the original spreadsheet layout of TEAMS into GREET with an easy to use interface. The plugin was developed by Rob Clifford (@Grub0) and Shayde Nofziger (@ShaydeNofziger). The project was headed by [Dr. James Winebrake](http://people.rit.edu/jjwgpt/).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nMore information on the TEAMS project is available [here](rit.edu/cla/teams).\r\nMore information on the GREET application is available [here](https://greet.es.anl.gov/greet/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
